# Model_Informed_Machine_Learning
Code and Trained Models for Model_Informed_Machine_Learning.

We have uploaded a notebook which shows the training of the network/loss functions on a sample dataset. 
Once we obtain permission for sharing of real MRI data, we will upload a detailed notebook showing how to use MIML in practice. 

We note that the code for generating EPG datasets are based on https://github.com/kelvinlayton/T2estimation

Tested with Python 3.6, using Tensorflow 2.0
