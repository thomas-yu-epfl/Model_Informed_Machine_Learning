# Model_Informed_Machine_Learning
Code for Model_Informed_Machine_Learning.

We have uploaded a notebook which shows the training of the network/loss functions on a sample dataset. 
Once we obtain permission for sharing of real MRI data, we will upload a detailed notebook showing how to use MIML in practice on real data, along with the trained models for the datasets we have already constructed.

We note that the code for generating EPG datasets are based on https://github.com/kelvinlayton/T2estimation

Tested with Python 3.6, using Tensorflow 2.0
