We have uploaded a notebook which shows the training of the network/loss functions on a sample dataset. 

A full tutorial for usage + code available after publication

We note that the code for generating EPG datasets are based on https://github.com/kelvinlayton/T2estimation

Tested with Python 3.6, using Tensorflow 2.0
