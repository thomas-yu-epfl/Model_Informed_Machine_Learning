# Model_Informed_Machine_Learning
Code for Model_Informed_Machine_Learning.

We have uploaded a notebook which shows the training of the network/loss functions on a sample dataset. 

A full tutorial for usage + code available after publication

We note that the code for generating EPG datasets are based on https://github.com/kelvinlayton/T2estimation
